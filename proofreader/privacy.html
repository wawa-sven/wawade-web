    Privacy Policy for Proofreader
    Effective date: October 28, 2025

    1. Introduction

    Wawade AB (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy when you use our proofreading add-on
    for Google Docs (the “Add-On”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we
    protect it, and your rights in relation to that information.

    By installing or using the Add-On, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
    policy.

    2. What information we collect

    2.1 Information you provide
    • When you install and grant permissions to the Add-On, you may provide us with your Google account identifier
    (e.g., via OAuth) only to the extent necessary for the Add-On’s functionality.
    • If you contact us (e.g., support) you may supply your email address and related information.

    2.2 Information automatically collected or processed
    • The Add-On will access the content of the document(s) in Google Docs only insofar as needed to perform
    proofreading tasks (e.g., text of the document).
    • We do not collect or store personal identifiers (such as name, address), unless you explicitly submit such data
    (for example in a support request).
    • We may log anonymised usage data (e.g., which features are used, error reports) to help improve the Add-On.

    3. How we use your information
    • To provide and maintain the Add-On’s functionality (proofreading, grammar/spell-check).
    • To monitor usage and improve our Add-On (performance monitoring, fix bugs, develop new features).
    • To respond to your support inquiries or requests.
    • We do not use your document content for advertising or share it with third parties for marketing purposes.

    4. Data sharing and disclosure
    • We will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.
    • We may share anonymised aggregated usage statistics (that cannot identify you) with trusted third-party services
    (e.g., analytics).
    • We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety of users.

    5. Data retention
    • Document content processed for proofreading is accessed in real-time and is not stored by us permanently (unless
    you explicitly request storage in a separate service).
    • Usage logs and anonymised analytics are retained for up to [e.g., 12 months] and then securely deleted or
    anonymised.

    6. Security
    • We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your information from unauthorised
    access, alteration, disclosure or destruction.
    • Data transmissions (where relevant) are encrypted (e.g., via HTTPS).
    • However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100 % secure, so we cannot
    guarantee absolute security.

    7. Your rights

    Depending on your jurisdiction (especially the EU under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), you may have the
    following rights:
    • Access: You can ask what personal data we hold about you.
    • Rectification: You may ask us to correct incomplete or inaccurate data.
    • Erasure: You may request deletion of your personal data.
    • Restriction/Objection: You may ask us to restrict processing or object to processing.
    • Data portability: If applicable, you may request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used format.
    To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [your contact email].

    8. International transfers

    If we transfer your data outside your country (for example, outside the EEA), we will ensure appropriate safeguards
    are in place (e.g., standard contractual clauses) in accordance with applicable law.

    9. Children

    The Add-On is not intended for use by children under the age of 16 (or whatever age is relevant under your local
    law). If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps
    to delete such information.

    10. Changes to this Privacy Policy

    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” at the top will indicate when it was last
    revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. If we make material changes, we will notify you via
    the Add-On interface or our website.
