        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wawade AB (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy when you
            use our Google Docs add-on, Proofreader (the &quot;Add-On&quot;). This Privacy Policy explains what
            information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and your rights in relation to that information.
        </p>
        <p>By installing or using the Add-On, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this
            policy.</p>

        <h2>2. What information we collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you install and grant permissions to the Add-On, you may provide us with your Google account
                identifier (for example, via OAuth) only to the extent necessary for the Add-On’s functionality.</li>
            <li>If you contact us (for example, for support) you may supply your email address and related information.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Information automatically collected or processed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Add-On accesses the content of your Google Docs document only insofar as needed to perform
                proofreading tasks, such as reading the text of the document.</li>
            <li>Where necessary to generate proofreading suggestions, the Add-On may transmit relevant text to
                third-party AI services for the duration of the request.</li>
            <li>In some cases, small excerpts of document text may be stored temporarily to diagnose issues or improve
                the service. These excerpts are used <strong>only</strong> for diagnostics and are not used for any
                other purpose, including training AI models.</li>
            <li>We do not collect or store personal identifiers (such as your name or address), unless you explicitly
                submit such data, for example in a support request.</li>
            <li>We may log non-content usage data (for example, feature usage or error codes) to help maintain and
                improve the Add-On.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the Add-On’s functionality.</li>
            <li>To monitor usage and improve the Add-On, such as performance monitoring, fixing bugs, or developing new
                features.</li>
            <li>To respond to your support inquiries or requests.</li>
            <li>We do not use your document content for advertising or share it with third parties for marketing
                purposes, and we do not sell or lease your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties.</li>
            <li>We may share usage statistics with trusted third-party services, such as analytics providers.</li>
            <li>If we transmit document text to third-party AI services, it is only to perform the requested
                proofreading task. The service provider does not retain the content or use it to train models.</li>
            <li>We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of
                users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Document content is processed in real time and is not stored by us permanently.</li>
            <li>If diagnostic logs are generated, they may include excerpts of document text. These logs are stored for up to <strong>30 days</strong> and then permanently deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from
                unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</li>
            <li>Data transmissions, where relevant, are encrypted (for example, via HTTPS).</li>
            <li>However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so
                we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
        <p>If document text or diagnostic logs are processed by third-party AI services located outside your
            jurisdiction (for example, outside the EU/EEA), we will apply appropriate safeguards in accordance with
            applicable law.</p>

        <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are in the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation,
            GDPR), you may have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can ask what personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> You may ask us to correct incomplete or inaccurate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> You may request deletion of your personal data (including any diagnostic
                logs).</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction/Objection:</strong> You may ask us to restrict processing or object to processing,
                including diagnostic logging.</li>
            <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> If applicable, you may request a copy of your data in a structured,
                commonly used format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@wawade.com">info@wawade.com</a>.
